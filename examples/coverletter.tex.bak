  % Canonical

  I'm reaching out because I'd love to join the Mir Team. I've spent over
  ten years writing C++ for simulation software that deals heavily with 3D
  rendering and image processing. That kind of work taught me a lot about
  performance, precision, and the small details that make visual systems both
  fast and beautiful.

  Over time, I've grown especially interested in the lower layers, how pixels
  actually make it to the screen, how GPUs behave under pressure, and how smart
  architecture decisions can make everything smoother. I've also been teaching
  myself Rust, which I've really come to enjoy for its blend of safety and
  control. Seeing how Mozilla uses it to push the web forward has been a big
  inspiration.
  control.

  I'd be thrilled to work on the engine that powers Firefox, helping it paint
  faster, use less power, and feel great to use across all kinds of devices.
  I'm drawn to Mozilla's mix of technical excellence and openness. It's rare
  to find a place where performance, user respect, and community all matter
  equally.
  I'd be thrilled to work for Canonical. I've been a big fan and heavy user of
  OSS for such a long time. It would be a great joy to give back to the
  community while contributing to a such interesting project.

  Thanks for taking the time to read this. I'd be happy to chat about how my
  experience and curiosity could fit into what you're building.

  % I’m excited to apply for the Haskell developer position.
  %
  % I’ve been working with Haskell for some time now and I really enjoy building
  %   reliable systems with it. What draws me to LivTours is the combination of a
  %   modern Haskell stack and a product that genuinely enhances people’s travel
  %   experiences. It’s great to see functional programming used in such a
  %   tangible, real-world context.
  %
  % I’d love the chance to contribute to your platform, learn from your team, and
  %   help build tools that make personalized travel smoother and more enjoyable.
