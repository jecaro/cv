\cvsection{Summary}

\begin{cvparagraph}

  I am a software developer with extensive experience in a wide range of
  domains. I have worked as a backend developer, have written desktop
  applications, simulation software as well as network servers.

  Over the years, I have had the opportunity to work with low-level,
  object-oriented languages such as C++, which I have used professionally for
  more than a decade, as well as high-level functional languages such as
  Haskell. This combination of experiences has given me a strong understanding
  of the principles that drive software development, always with the goal of
  creating correct, safe, and reliable systems.
