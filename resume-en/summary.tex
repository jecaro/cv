\cvsection{Summary}

\begin{cvparagraph}

    I am a software developer with a large experience in very diverse fields.
    I have worked as a backend developer, have wrote desktop applications,
    simulation software as well as network servers.

    I have had the chance to work with low level object orientated programming
    such as C++ which I have used professionally for more than ten years, and
    also with very high level functional programming languages such as Haskell.
    Theses different approaches give me a good comprehension of the mechanisms
    at work in software development, always driven by the goal of developing
    correct, safe and robust software.
